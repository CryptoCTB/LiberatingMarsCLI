# LiberatingMarsCLI
**We don't want to be forced into which Slicer we use. Let's change that.**

### Usage:
LiberatingMarsCLI(.exe) [path to ChiTuBox 1.9.0] [path to legacy CTB file]

### Output:
[file name]_MARS3.ctb

- Layer specific settings and TSMC are not implemented.

We hope this will help the community to avoid ChiTu's SDK, which is not the solution we hoped for or expected.
